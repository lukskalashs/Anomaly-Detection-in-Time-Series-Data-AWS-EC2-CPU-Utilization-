# Anomaly-Detection-in-Time-Series-Data-AWS-EC2-CPU-Utilization-
A hybrid machine-learning anomaly detection system using sliding windows, statistical thresholds, and ensemble models (Isolation Forest, OC-SVM, LOF). Achieved ~90% F1-score across EC2 CPU time-series data. I led the full Python implementation, model design, and evaluation.
